# Personality Test Analyzer
Welcome to PTARM (Personality Test Analyzer Read Me) in this read me file you will learn how to use the PTARM and how it works. 

The PTARM is a data analyzer that analyzes the data from the [Keirsey Personality Test](https://www.keirsey.com/). It scores you on 4 categorys, Introvert or extrovert (IE), Sensing or Intution (SE), Thinking or Feeling (TF), Judging or Preceiving (JP).

## How to use the PTARM
The first step in using the PTARM is understanding the files given. When you open the repository you are greeted 6 files (excluding README.md), 3 text files and 3 python files. Each file is very important for the operation of the PTARM.

#### PTARM .txt files
* output.txt
The output.txt file is the file that has the test results. They are formated in this way:

name: [IE number, SN number, TF number, JP number] = I or E, S or N, T or F, J or P

* The IE number is precentage of introvert that the person is. The closer to 100 the more introverted they are, if they are less than 50 they are more extroverted.
* The SN number is precentage of iNtution that the person is. The closer to 100 the more Intution they have, if they are less than 50 they are more Sensing.
* The TF number is precentage of feeling that the person is. The closer to 100 the more feeling they are, if they are less than 50 they are more thinking.
* The JP number is precentage of preceiving that the person is. The closer to 100 the more preceiving they are, if they are less than 50 they are more judging.
For all of these categorys if the number is 50 than an X will he displayed.

Real example:

Erin Blake: [78, 37, 61, 35] = ISFJ

Ben Carlson: [46, 45, 23, 90] = ESTP
